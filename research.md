# The Ideological Nationalization of Mass Partisanship

### Policy Preferences and Partisan Identification in State Publics, 1946–2014

Working paper with [Devin Caughey](http://caughey.mit.edu/welcome) and [Christopher Warshaw](http://web.mit.edu/~cwarshaw/www/).

*Abstract:* Since the mid-20th century, elite political behavior has increasingly
nationalized. In Congress, for example, within-party geographic cleavages have
declined, roll-call voting has become increasingly one-dimensional, and
Democrats and Republicans have diverged along this main dimension of national
partisan conflict. The existing literature finds that citizens have displayed
only a delayed and attenuated echo of elite trends. We show, however, that a
very different picture emerges if we focus not on individual citizens but on the
aggregate characteristics of geographic constituencies.  Using estimates of the
economic, racial, and social policy liberalism of the average Democrat,
Independent, and Republican in each state-year 1946–2014, we demonstrate a
surprisingly close correspondence between mass and elite trends. Specifically,
we find that: (1) ideological divergence between Democrats and Republicans has
increased dramatically within each domain, just as it has in Congress; (2)
economic, racial, and social liberalism have become highly correlated across
state-party publics, just as they have across members of Congress; (3)
ideological variation across state-party publics is now almost completely
explained by party rather than state, closely tracking trends in the Senate; and
(4) senators' liberalism is strongly predicted by the liberalism of their
state-party subconstituency, even controlling for their party a liation and
their state public’s overall liberalism. Taken together, this correspondence
between elite and mass patterns suggests that members of Congress are actually
quite in synch with their constituencies, if not with individual citizens.
