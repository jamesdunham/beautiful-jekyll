## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="portrait-icon.jpg">

I work in prediction and inference around politics and policy.
My technical focus is on measurement problems involving information extraction, entity linkage, and latent variables.

I received a Ph.D. in political science from MIT in fall 2018.
I previously studied public policy at NYU for an M.P.A. and built digital campaigns for issue-advocacy groups.

## Code

I write Python and SQL for work.
Graduate training immersed me in R.
I use JS for D3, Dash, or Shiny.

[dgo](../dgo) implements dynamic estimation of latent characteristics using multilevel Bayesian models.
It implements a method for estimating subpopulation means from individual-level item response data.
Written in R with [Devin Caughey](https://caughey.mit.edu/welcome) and [Christopher Warshaw](http://www.chriswarshaw.com/) across a number of projects, including our paper below.

I wrote [qsurvey](../qsurvey) while staffing [MIT PERL](http://web.mit.edu/polisci/research/perl.html).
It's a toolkit for R users working with the Qualtrics platform: designing surveys and analyzing results.

From my time at the MIT [Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu), you can find one example of a Python package for [data management](https://github.com/MEDSL/data-management) and another generating [consistent documentation](https://github.com/MEDSL/documentation) through Jinja templating.

## Publications

"The Ideological Nationalization of Partisan Subconstituencies in the American States," with Devin Caughey and Christopher Warshaw, in [*Public Choice:*](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-018-0543-3)

> Since the mid-twentieth century, elite political behavior in the United States
> has become much more nationalized. In Congress, for example, within-party
> geographic cleavages have declined, roll-call voting has become more
> one-dimensional, and Democrats and Republicans have diverged along this main
> dimension of national partisan conflict. The existing literature finds that
> citizens have only weakly and belatedly mimicked elite trends. We show,
> however, that a different picture emerges if we focus not on individual
> citizens, but on the aggregate characteristics of geographic constituencies.
>
> Using biennial estimates of the economic, racial, and social policy liberalism
> of the average Democrat and Republican in each state over the past six
> decades, we demonstrate a surprisingly close correspondence between mass and
> elite trends. Specifically, we find that: (1) ideological divergence between
> Democrats and Republicans has widened dramatically within each domain, just as
> it has in Congress; (2) ideological variation across senatorsâ€™ partisan
> subconstituencies is now explained almost completely by party rather than
> state, closely tracking trends in the Senate; and (3) economic, racial, and
> social liberalism have become highly correlated across partisan
> subconstituencies, just as they have across members of Congress. Overall, our
> findings contradict the reigning consensus that polarization in Congress has
> proceeded much more rapidly and extensively than polarization in the mass
> public.

"Voter ID Laws: A View from the Public," with Paul Gronke, William D. Hicks, Seth C. McKee, and Charles Stewart III, in [*Social Science Quarterly:*](https://doi.org/10.1111/ssqu.12541)

> Voter identification (ID) emerged as a policy innovation during elite debate
> over lessons learned from the 2000 election, but as proposals for new strict
> ID laws have swept the states, it has resonated among the mass public as
> well. As we show, although there were clearly partisan differences over the
> necessity and form of photo ID laws from the beginning, the public began the
> decade of the 2000s by and large favorably disposed toward such laws. This
> favorable disposition included all relevant demographic groups. However, the
> popular consensus on voter ID laws has frayed. We document the decline of
> this consensus and explore the ways that partisanship now shapes two views of
> strict photo ID laws.  
>
> For Republicans, favorability about the effects of photo ID laws appears to
> have attained the status of party orthodoxy. For Democrats, attitudes about
> the effects of photo ID laws are much more variable. The greater diversity in
> Democratic opinion resembles the political reality of a party that is more
> heterogeneous than its opposition.
