I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [political
science](http://web.mit.edu/polisci/index.html) at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology specializing in how policymaking in the United States responds to
public opinion and interest-group activity.

In my [dissertation](research/), I examine how organized groups mediate policy
responsiveness. I study how the activity of groups like business and
professional associations affects the connection between the public and its
representatives.

My [other work](research/) addresses related questions of access and representation: how
citizen redistricting in California influenced legislators; the effects of
personal interactions with ID requirements on voter perceptions of the
election system; and the dynamics of partisan polarization in the American
public.

My technical interests are in unstructured data and natural language processing;
survey methods; and research design for causal inference.
