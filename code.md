## qsurvey

[qsurvey](https://github.com/jamesdunham/qsurvey) is a toolkit for working with
the [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/research-suite) platform and its survey
data in R. Download responses and designs directly into a session, then:

* Represent survey flows as directed graphs for interactive review in Shiny
* Examine branching, randomization, and question attributes like validation
* Map question ids to labels (`QID7` ⟷ `trust`) and translate between choice
  codes and descriptions (`2` ⟷ `disapprove`) in response data

## dgo

[dgo](https://github.com/jamesdunham/dgo) is an R package for dynamic estimation
of group-level opinion with multilevel Bayesian models.
