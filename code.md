## dgo

[dgo](../dgo) is an R package for dynamic estimation of latent characteristics
using multilevel Bayesian models. It implements a method for estimating
subpopulation-group means from individual-level item response data.


## qsurvey

[qsurvey](../qsurvey) is a toolkit for working with the Qualtrics platform and
its survey data in R. It focuses on testing and review of surveys before
fielding, and analysis of responses afterward. I started qsurvey while staffing
[MIT PERL](http://web.mit.edu/polisci/research/perl.html).
