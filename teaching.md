Most recently, I was a TA for [17.802 Quantitative Research Methods
II](https://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/17/sp15/17.802/index.html) at MIT 
in the spring of 2015. I also completed the Kaufman Teaching 
Certificate Program in 2015.

In 2014, I was a TA for NYU Wagner's Making Public Policy course; in 
2013, for Statistical Methods.
